# CITI-OpenLung
An another [IN PROGRESS] open source, low cost, low resource, quick deployment ventilator design that utilizes a Ambu-bag as a core component.  'War' against COVID-19

We are expecting (here in Brazil) the peak of covid-19 in 3 weeks (April 10th). The demand for mechanical ventilator is critical, it is the biggest cause of death of the covid-19. We are fighting time to develop an open-source ventilator that can be manufactured on time.

## Why another?

We are trying to develop a ventilator that has accessible and available parts here in brazil.

# Status

- March 20: Project started
- March 21: 3D Model in progress [80%]

Pending:
- 3D model
- Bill of materials
- Pressure sensor? mpx4250? MPS20N0040D?


## Main requirements:

- Be reliable. It must work continuously without failure (100% duty cycle) for blocks of 14days â€” 24 hours a day. If necessary, the machine may be replaced after each block of 14 days x 24 hours a day use.

- Provide at least two settings for volume of air/air O2 mix delivered per cycle/breath. These settings to be 450ml +/- 10ml per breath and 350ml +/- 10ml per breath.

- Provide this air/air O2 mix at a peak pressure of 350 mm H2O.

- Have the capability for patient supply pipework to remain pressurised at all times to 150mm H20.

- Have an adjustable rate of between 12 and 20 cycles/breaths per minute.

- Deliver at least 400ml of air/air 02 mix in no more than 1.5 seconds. The ability to change the rate at which air is pushed into the patient is desirable but not essential.
